Allow people to respect quarantines and self isolation

## Idea:

- Build an app, or easily accessible website, that keeps track of your health status and your location.

## Aim:

- Allow people to respect quarantines and self isolation
- Get an idea on the number of people affected by the disease but not officially tested
- Facilitate communication between local helpers and people in needHow would it work?

The app allows you to log your health status by asking you whether you feel healthy or sick. A questionnaire follows.

- In case you are healthy, it asks whether you live with other people and if they are healthy as well. In that case it asks you if you would be up to help someone in need (e.g. by buying grocieries).
- If you are sick, the app asks you if you have been tested and for how long you've been having symptoms (the first time). Then it asks your symptoms (you choose from a list or add "other") and if you have a fever you can enter your temperature. Eventually it asks if you need help with shopping. 

Everyday the app asks the same questionnaire and saves your data in a form of calendar entry, so you see your healthy days and your sick days. It could also show you the suggested time you should still stay at home to be safe you overcame the illness when you get better.
