    <div class="content">
      <p class="transition hidden">By recording your health status. It is done by a series of Questions and Answers.</p>
      <p class="transition hidden">In case you are healthy, it asks whether you live with other people and if they are healthy as well. In that case it asks you if you would be up to help someone in need (e.g. by buying groceries).</p>
      <p class="transition hidden">If you are sick, the app asks you if you have been tested and for how long you've been having symptoms (the first time). Then it asks your symptoms (you choose from a list or add "other") and if you have a fever you can enter your temperature. Eventually it asks if you need help with shopping. Everyday the app asks the same questionnaire and saves your data in a form of calendar entry, so you see your healthy days and your sick days. It could also show you the suggested time you should still stay at home to be safe you overcame the illness when you get better.</p>
